### Code example:

**Leap Years KATA from CODEWARS:**
In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not.
In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

- years divisible by 4 are leap years
- but years divisible by 100 are not leap years
- but years divisible by 400 are leap years*

```
public static class Kata
{
  public static bool IsLeapYear(int year)
  {
     return DateTime.IsLeapYear(year);
